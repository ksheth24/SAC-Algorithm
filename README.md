# New Jersey SEWA Sponsor a Child Filtering Algorithm - Diwali 2023 Campaign
The purpose of this project is to identify New Jersey residents who are likely to donate to make donations to a marketing campaign for a non profit called Sponsor a Child. Using pandas, the software compares an XLSX file of open source NJ resident data to specific key words (contained in an XLSX file), helping us narrow down our original 5.4 million data entries to about 19,000. The basic framework presented in this project can be used and adapted to a variety of cases, the fundamental use case lies in the software's ability to traverse through two separate excel files and compare the contents.
